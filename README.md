## Hi there, I am Arturo Lopez. 👋🏾
### Mexican 🇲🇽 | Software Developer 👨🏾‍💻 | Engineer | Consultant

#### I currently reside in the Bay Area, Northern California. I enjoy staying active by doing outdoor things with friends - going on hikes, playing soccer ⚽.

#### I work at Accenture as a Technology Analyst.

#### I also do Web Consulting on the side. I help clients showcase their product or service online. My services include Full Stack Development, Responsive Web Design, and E-Commerce sites.

#### For my web development, I usually use Javascript, HTML and CSS. For some front end apps, I also use React. I design using Adobe Xd, Illustrator, and Figma. Recently, I have started learning Liquid, Shopify's Theme Templating Language.
